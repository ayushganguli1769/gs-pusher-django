    <h1>Pusher Private Channel Code Sample</h1>

    <p class="description">
      <a href="https://pusher.com/docs/private_channels">Private channels</a> are channels that require authentication. Authentication is made upon subscription and to allow the subscription you must implement an <a href="https://pusher.com/docs/authenticating_users">Authentication endpoint</a> which signs the subscription request.
    </p>

    <p class="use-case">
      Private channnels are exactly like public channels, except they require you to authenticate the subscription. The most common use case for private channels is to protect private user or system information.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can also trigger events directly on private channels from the client. To do so you must enable client events for your application within the <a href="https://dashboard.pusher.com">Pusher Dashboard</a>. For more information on client events see <a href="https://pusher.com/docs/client_events">the client event docs</a>

      <h2>Instructions</h2>

      <p class="page-instructions">
        To use this code example, take a look at the source of <a href="https://github.com/pusher-community/gs-pusher-rails/blob/master/app/views/private/index.html.erb>views/private/index.html.erb</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pusher-community/gs-pusher-rails/blob/master/app/controllers/private_controller.rb>private_controller.rb</a>.
